if your reading this, it means you in a older version whre there are purchase and sales 
which you will get rid of in the future,

i hope that when you read this again you are better at php and laravel and can actaully build thing own you own also i plan to focus on this for now and forget about data mining
because if i cant even build this then i dont deserve to be a data sciencetist, but i will continue reading about it because i love it and plan to persui it someday and i want to read books about it to build foundation to when i actually use it hope when i read this i now understand the basic concept and if i do this will prove that books are a good resource for me even if i had a hard time with it 

25/07/2025 right now and hopefully you are doing better in life and in your career remember never give up even if this end up being a waste of time at least you build a project might be completely own you own but its something, this should teach you a good lesson that will help you in your carrer


this is a turning point in my career either this succeed and i get  to break in to tech 
or this fail and i end up wasting my time,well both will not be bad aslong as i am improving becuae i learn alot of things that i dont even use or i dont know how to use it anymore and i waste alot of time on it example is postgress,excel,rapidminer,r
