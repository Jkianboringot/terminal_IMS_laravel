goal:
1.change all 'client' terms to customer
	-relationships
		1.qoutation
		2.orders
		3.invoices
		4.salespayment
		5.purchasepayment
2.fix notication make it point to inventory balance not quantity
	-i actually wnat to add this threshold thing, that i dint even though of this before
	example:
		image this you have a store with different product toys,jewlery,food and so you have a noti
	system that constantly checks the inventry level and you could make it so that all of them the
	same threshold that when meet give you an alert like 'hey this product qty is low' let say all of them
	has a 10 threshold meaning if their qty hit 10 it will alert you of the product that hit 10, and that
	good easy to comprehend and make but thier is one problem supply and demand, not all of the demand 
	for them are the same meaning their are product that might go well with 10 as a threshold such as 
	jewelry,toys because they dont get buy out as fast, but that should'nt be done on foods why , because most commonly food are the fasted
	the fast consumtion or buy out ,so if everytime you wait for the quantity of you food ingredient to get to 10qty 
	before resupplying, that can cause you a loss in money becuase what if customer buys more than what you
	are capable of making becuase of your stock being low but what if you can make the threshold customazable
	like food can have a threshold of 50qty then it give you an alert, this can help you with not being 
	under stock with different product base on their demand and so this is why u want to put this
	in the app
	- test if threshold works same with location and oragnization_type
